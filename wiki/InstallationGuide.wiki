#summary Everything from downloading the source code to running the aggregator.

= Introduction =

This document should help you get started with the aggregation service. It provides links to every single step required to set up the rss-toolkit's services.

= Preparation and required software =

  * We assume Linux or BSD environment is used (no support for Windows, although there should be no problems with it).
  * [http://ant.apache.org/ Apache ANT] will be required to compile the sources.
  * [http://subversion.tigris.org/ Subversion] client will be required to fetch the code from the repository.
  * [http://www.postgresql.org/ PostgreSQL] needs to be installed and configured.
  * Java virtual machine, SUN's Java 1.6 or later is recommended.
  * A servlet container such as Jetty (a preconfigured container is included in the distribution).
  * Administrative privileges on the server will be required to set up the service.
