The project contains handy SQL scripts that may accelerate further steps. They are located in `deployment/db-schema` folder of the distribution. We provide their names where appropriate so that tons of SQL do not have to be included on this page.

{{{
CREATE DATABASE feeds ENCODING='UTF8';

CREATE USER rssadmin WITH NOCREATEDB;
ALTER DATABASE feeds OWNER TO rssadmin;
ALTER USER rssadmin WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'CHANGEME';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE feeds TO rssadmin;
}}}

*`002.db-feeds.sql`*: Add tables and indices for storing feeds.

*`003.db-status.sql`*: Add tables and indices for storing indexing status.
